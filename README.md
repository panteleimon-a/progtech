Hi,

My name is Panteleimon Angelidis, and I am a candidate of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of National Technical University of Athens.
I created this repo to share with other candidates my work on one of the courses to which I was examined named "Progtech".

You can find the link of the course here: https://courses.softlab.ntua.gr/progtech/2020a/


In the beginning of my studies in C++, I was a total beginner in the language, with a tiny experience in JS. I'd expect the content of the programs I
created to be sufficient enough for beginners, as well as for candidates with advanced knowledge. The program material amounts to 3/4 out of the total
rating of the course.


Feel free to contribute.
