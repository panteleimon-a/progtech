If both components have the same size, the choice of which root becomes the parent is arbitrary. This strategy helps to keep the trees relatively flat, which is important for the efficiency of find operations. A key principle is that a parent node must always represent a component size that is greater than or equal to the component size of its child *at the time of union*.\n",
